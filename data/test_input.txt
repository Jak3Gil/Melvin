This is a test document for Melvin's cognitive architecture. The system processes text by creating nodes for each character and forming connections through temporal co-occurrence. As more text flows through the system, patterns emerge through the activation of connected nodes.

Melvin learns by connecting nodes that appear together in time, building understanding through simple association rather than explicit labels or rules.
