SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The graph structure contains nodes representing sensory chunks and edges representing temporal co activation patterns.

Each node contains a payload of fixed size depending on modality with vision using 768 bytes audio using 640 bytes and text using 1 byte.

Connection formation happens when new nodes appear connecting to their temporal neighbors within a specified radius.

Weight updates occur when nodes appear together repeatedly with connection strength increasing based on co occurrence frequency.

Generalization emerges through leap node consolidation where three fully connected nodes merge into a single abstract representation.

Coherence measures the ratio of internal weights between active nodes to external weights connecting to inactive regions of the graph.

Reasoning continues until the activation field reaches stability defined by low variance in energy distribution across nodes.

The output layer routes active nodes to appropriate channels including motor control audio synthesis visual attention and text generation.

Evolution adapts parameters over time based on fitness metrics including prediction accuracy coherence stability and computational efficiency.

Pruning removes low frequency nodes and edges keeping the graph focused on recent and frequently used patterns.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Memory allocation uses efficient storage for variable sized payloads with ascending node IDs representing temporal order.

Thread safety ensures concurrent access to the graph through shared mutexes and atomic operations for node ID generation.

The feedback loop closes the perception action cycle by routing all outputs back into the intake layer as new sensory data.

Motor control interfaces with hardware via CAN bus protocol sending position velocity and torque commands based on active motor nodes.

Visual attention dynamically shifts a 16 by 16 pixel window across input based on which vision nodes have highest activation.

Audio output processes active audio nodes sending samples to speakers or text to speech systems based on payload content.

Text output concatenates characters from active text nodes creating readable output streams.
