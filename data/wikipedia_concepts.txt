COMPUTER SCIENCE

Computer science is the study of computation information processing and the theoretical foundations of computer hardware and software.

Algorithms are step by step procedures for solving problems or accomplishing tasks. They form the backbone of computational thinking.

Machine learning enables computers to improve performance on tasks through experience without being explicitly programmed for every case.

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks that learn to recognize patterns in data.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Artificial intelligence aims to create systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence such as reasoning learning perception and language understanding.

Deep learning uses multiple layers of artificial neurons to extract hierarchical features from raw data enabling breakthroughs in vision speech and natural language processing.

Reinforcement learning trains agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesired ones creating systems that improve through interaction.

Natural language processing focuses on enabling computers to understand generate and manipulate human language bridging the gap between machines and human communication.

COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES

Cognitive architectures attempt to model the principles underlying human thought including memory learning reasoning and perception.

Unified architectures seek to represent all sensory modalities and cognitive processes within a single coherent framework without separate specialized modules for each function.

Graph based knowledge representation connects concepts through weighted edges creating networks that can support retrieval generalization and inference.

Energy field dynamics simulate the spread of activation through networks modeling how attention patterns emerge from local interactions.

EMBODIED AI

Embodied artificial intelligence proposes that intelligent behavior emerges from the interaction between perception action and environment rather than from abstract symbol manipulation alone.

Motor babbling describes how young creatures explore their actuators generating random movements and learning the consequences through sensory feedback creating sensorimotor mappings.

Predictive coding suggests that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and only updates models when prediction errors occur.

Recurrent loops enable systems to maintain state over time allowing past experiences to influence present decisions.
