# ðŸš€ Quick Deploy to Jetson via USB

## Prerequisites

1. **Jetson connected to Mac via USB**
2. **sshpass installed on Mac:**
   ```bash
   brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass
   ```

## One-Command Deployment

```bash
cd deployment
./jetson_deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. âœ… Check for sshpass (install if needed)
2. âœ… Connect to Jetson at `192.168.55.1` (default USB network IP)
3. âœ… Transfer all files automatically
4. âœ… Install dependencies (with password automation)
5. âœ… Build Melvin
6. âœ… Create and start systemd service
7. âœ… Enable service to start on boot

## What It Does

- **Username:** `melvin`
- **Password:** `123456` (hardcoded in script)
- **IP:** `192.168.55.1` (Jetson USB network default)

If your Jetson has a different IP, edit `jetson_deploy.sh`:
```bash
JETSON_HOST="your-jetson-ip"
```

## After Deployment

Melvin will be running as a systemd service. To check:

```bash
# SSH to Jetson
sshpass -p '123456' ssh melvin@192.168.55.1

# Check status
sudo systemctl status melvin

# View logs
journalctl -u melvin -f

# Stop/restart
sudo systemctl stop melvin
sudo systemctl start melvin
```

## Troubleshooting

**Connection fails:**
```bash
# Check if Jetson is reachable
ping 192.168.55.1

# Try different IP (if Jetson is on WiFi/network)
# Edit JETSON_HOST in jetson_deploy.sh
```

**sudo password prompts:**
- The script configures passwordless sudo for the `melvin` user
- If it still prompts, the configuration may have failed
- You can manually configure: `echo "melvin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/melvin`

**Build fails:**
- Check if all dependencies installed: `dpkg -l | grep -E "opencv|alsa|can"`
- Re-run deployment script - it's idempotent

---

**That's it! Melvin will be always-on after deployment.** ðŸŽ‰
