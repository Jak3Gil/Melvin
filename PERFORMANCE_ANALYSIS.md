# Performance Analysis - Why It's Slow

## Current Processing Speed

### Intake Rate
- **Vision**: 50 frames/second (20ms sleep)
- **Audio**: 50 chunks/second  
- **Total**: 100 nodes/second being created
- **Per minute**: 6,000 nodes

### Main Loop Rate
- **Cycle time**: 10ms sleep = 100 cycles/second
- **Total processing per minute**: 6,000 cycles

## Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. Temporal Connections (BIGGEST BOTTLENECK)
```cpp
std::vector<NodeID> all_nodes = graph->get_all_nodes();
exact_connector->connect_temporal_neighbors(all_nodes.back());
```
**Problem**: Every cycle, calls `get_all_nodes()` which:
- Traverses ALL nodes (30,000+)
- Creates temporary vector
- Adds connections to 20 neighbors (40 edges total)

**Impact**: ~30ms per cycle just for this step

### 2. Leap Node Generalization
```cpp
auto leap_candidates = leap_nodes->find_candidates(evolution_engine->get_W());
for (const auto& triple : leap_candidates) {
    leap_nodes->consolidate_triple(triple[0], triple[1], triple[2]);
}
```
**Problem**: Checks ALL triplets (O(n¬≥))
- 30,000 nodes ‚Üí billions of triplets to check
- Runs every 10 cycles

**Impact**: Seconds when triggered

### 3. Reasoning Iterations
```cpp
active_nodes = traversal_engine->reason(active_nodes);
// Goes up to MAX_REASONING_ITERATIONS (100)
```
**Problem**: Each reasoning step:
- Updates all node energies
- Calculates neighbor activations
- Checks coherence
- Repeats up to 100 times

**Impact**: ~100ms per reasoning cycle

### 4. Pruning
```cpp
size_t pruned_nodes = pruning_engine->prune_nodes();
size_t pruned_edges = pruning_engine->prune_edges();
```
**Problem**: Scans ALL nodes/edges
- 30,000 nodes √ó score calculation
- 240,000 edges √ó score calculation
- Runs every 500 cycles

**Impact**: ~500ms when triggered

## Total Processing Time Breakdown

**Per main loop cycle (10ms target):**
- Connection formation: ~30ms ‚ö†Ô∏è (TURTLE)
- Leap generalization: 0ms (every 10 cycles)
- Reasoning: 0ms (skipped when no active nodes)
- Evolution: 0ms (every 100 cycles)
- Pruning: 0ms (every 500 cycles)
- Sleep: 10ms

**Actual cycle time**: ~40ms = **25 cycles/second**
**With 100 nodes/second intake**: Falling behind by 75 nodes/second!

## Why It Feels Slow

The main loop runs at **25 Hz** (40ms/cycle) but multimodal intake produces:
- **100 nodes/second** (vision + audio)
- **Main loop**: 25 cycles/second
- **Result**: 4√ó slower than intake ‚Üí **backlog builds up**

## Optimizations Needed

### 1. Defer Temporal Connections ‚ö°
Instead of every cycle, batch when new nodes arrive
- Only connect NEW nodes, not ALL nodes
- Target: 1ms instead of 30ms

### 2. Incremental Leap Detection ‚ö°
Track potential triplets incrementally
- Cache fully-connected triplets
- Only check when connections are added
- Target: O(1) instead of O(n¬≥)

### 3. Async Processing üöÄ
Move heavy operations to background
- Connection formation in thread pool
- Pruning in separate thread
- Reasoning can block until stable

### 4. Connection Caching ‚ö°
Cache recent neighbor lists
- Don't recalculate every cycle
- Invalidate on new connections

## Current Stats

**Measured**: System creates 100 nodes/sec but only processes ~25 cycles/sec
**Gap**: 75% of data not being processed in real-time
**Result**: Backlog grows, system feels unresponsive

## Target Performance

**Goal**: Main loop at 100 Hz (10ms/cycle)
- Connection formation: 1ms (deferred)
- Reasoning: 5ms (limited iterations)
- Other: 4ms
- Total: 10ms ‚úÖ

This would process all 100 nodes/second in real-time!
