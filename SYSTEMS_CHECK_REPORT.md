## ✅ VERIFIED CORE CAPABILITIES

### 1. **Unified Intelligence Pipeline** ✅  
**File:** `core/unified_intelligence.cpp`

**Complete reasoning flow:**
- ✅ **Intent Classification**: Determines what type of query (DEFINE, LOCATE, CAUSE, COMPARE, etc.)
- ✅ **Semantic Activation**: Spreads activation from query tokens through knowledge graph
- ✅ **Dynamic Scoring**: Uses genome parameters (α=semantic, β=activation, γ=coherence) to rank nodes
- ✅ **Answer Synthesis**: Generates natural language responses based on top-ranked concepts
- ✅ **Metrics Tracking**: Confidence, coherence, novelty computed in real-time
- ✅ **Hebbian Learning**: Automatically strengthens edges between co-activated nodes after each reasoning step
- ✅ **Reflection & Adaptation**: Autonomous mode switching based on performance

**Human-like feature:** Multi-stage pipeline mirrors human cognition (understanding → retrieval → evaluation → generation → learning).

---

### 2. **Graph Growth Mechanisms** ✅  
**Files:** `core/unified_intelligence.h/cpp`

**Dynamic learning capabilities:**
- ✅ **add_concept()**: Creates new nodes on-the-fly for novel concepts
- ✅ **strengthen_connection()**: Increases edge weights when concepts co-occur (Hebbian)
- ✅ **weaken_connection()**: Prunes edges that fall below threshold (synaptic pruning)
- ✅ **apply_hebbian_learning()**: Automatically called after every reasoning step to strengthen connections between co-activated nodes
- ✅ **Thread-safe mutations**: `graph_mutex_` and `std::atomic<int> next_node_id_` ensure concurrent access safety
- ✅ **Bidirectional edges**: Creates reverse edges for symmetric knowledge representation

**Human-like feature:** Knowledge graph grows organically like a human brain forming new neural connections through experience.

---

### 3. **Genome Adaptation** ✅  
**Files:** `core/evolution/dynamic_genome.h/cpp`

**Self-tuning parameters (82 genome variables total):**
- ✅ **Scoring weights (α, β, γ)**: Automatically adjust based on success/failure feedback
- ✅ **Temperature β(t)**: Adaptive exploration vs. exploitation (0.1-2.0 range)
- ✅ **Learning rates (η, κ)**: Meta-learning speed adapts based on stability
- ✅ **Confidence/semantic thresholds (θ, σ)**: Dynamic gating for activation spread
- ✅ **Mode-switching thresholds**: Autonomous transitions (exploratory → exploitative → focused → deep)
- ✅ **Conversational parameters**: Theta rhythm (4-8 Hz), turn-taking thresholds, emotional modulation scales
- ✅ **tune_from_feedback()**: Reinforces or adjusts weights based on correctness
- ✅ **adapt_temperature()**: Increases exploration when uncertain, exploitation when confident
- ✅ **Meta-learning profiles**: Learns best parameters for different query types (cached and reused)

**Human-like feature:** Like human brain plasticity, the system continuously tunes its own parameters based on experience and feedback.

---

### 4. **Metacognition** ✅  
**Files:** `core/metacognition/reflection_controller_dynamic.h/cpp`

**Autonomous self-monitoring and adaptation:**
- ✅ **5 reasoning modes**: EXPLORATORY, EXPLOITATIVE, FOCUSED, DEEP, BACKPRESSURE
- ✅ **Mode switching logic**: Autonomous decisions based on sliding window of confidence/coherence metrics
- ✅ **Cooldown mechanism**: Prevents rapid mode oscillation (MIN_CYCLES_BETWEEN_SWITCHES=3)

  - **EXPLORATORY**: ↑ temperature, ↓ thresholds (more exploration)
  - **EXPLOITATIVE**: ↓ temperature, ↑ thresholds (more focused)
  - **FOCUSED**: ↑ semantic bias, ↓ activation weight (quality over quantity)
  - **DEEP**: Allow deeper traversal, ↑ coherence weight (follow good paths further)
  - **BACKPRESSURE**: Drastically ↑ thresholds to throttle activation spread
- ✅ **Reflection history**: Logs all mode switches with reasons and metric snapshots

### 5. **Feedback Loops** ✅  
**Files:** `core/feedback/three_channel_feedback.h/cpp`, `cognitive_os/cognitive_os.cpp`

**Three complementary learning channels:**
1. **Sensory Feedback** (Physical consequences from environment)
   - Vision, audio, motor feedback events tracked
   - Reward signals (-1 to +1) from action outcomes
   - Temporal correlation between actions and rewards

2. **Cognitive Feedback** (Internal prediction errors)
   - Prediction errors logged: |predicted - actual|
   - Attention bias adjustments based on error patterns
   - Meta-learning: adaptive learning rate based on error trends

3. **Evolutionary Feedback** (Long-term parameter tuning)
   - Population of genome variants (size=7)
   - Fitness evaluation over smoothing window (100 cycles)
   - Selective mutation of correlated genes

## 🧠 LEARNING & ADAPTATION MECHANISMS

### How Melvin Learns Like a Human

1. **Hebbian Learning** (Automatic, fast):
   - After every reasoning step, `apply_hebbian_learning()` strengthens edges between co-activated nodes
   - Δw = η × activation_a × activation_b
   - Threshold: only nodes with activation > 0.3 participate
   - **Result:** Frequently co-occurring concepts become more strongly connected (like human associative memory)

2. **Feedback-Driven Tuning** (Supervised, medium speed):
   - When feedback events arrive (MOTOR_FEEDBACK, COG_FEEDBACK), `learn(correct)` is called
   - `tune_from_feedback()`: Adjusts α, β, γ based on success/failure
   - `adapt_temperature()`: Increases exploration if low confidence, exploitation if high
   - Meta-learning profiles cache best parameters for each intent type
   - **Result:** System self-optimizes its reasoning strategy based on outcomes

3. **Graph Growth** (Continuous, organic):
   - `add_concept()`: Creates new nodes when novel concepts detected
   - `strengthen_connection()`: Adds/reinforces edges when concepts co-occur
   - `weaken_connection()`: Prunes weak edges (< 0.01 threshold)
   - Thread-safe for concurrent growth from multiple sensory modalities
   - **Result:** Knowledge graph expands organically from experience (like human brain forming new connections)

4. **Metacognitive Adaptation** (Strategic, slow):
   - `ReflectionController` observes sliding window of metrics (confidence, coherence, active_nodes)
   - Autonomously switches modes when current strategy failing
   - Mode-specific parameter adjustments (temperature, thresholds, weight balances)
   - Cooldown prevents rapid switching
   - **Result:** System adapts its overall cognitive strategy based on performance trends

5. **Environment Adaptation** (Ready for Jetson):
   - Vision loop: Detects objects → extracts features → adds new concepts → strengthens co-occurrences
   - Audio loop: Speech recognition → phoneme sequence → concept activation → context strengthening
   - Motor loop: Action → feedback → reward signal → policy gradient update
   - **Result:** System adapts behavior to its embodied environment through sensorimotor experience

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**Melvin is FULLY OPERATIONAL and READY for Jetson deployment.**

All core cognitive capabilities—unified reasoning, graph growth, genome adaptation, metacognition, feedback loops, memory systems, emotional modulation, and concurrent OS—are implemented, tested, and verified on Mac. The system is designed to **learn and adapt like a human brain** through multiple complementary mechanisms operating at different timescales.

Hardware-specific functionality (cameras, microphone, speakers, CAN bus motors) is stubbed on Mac for development but will activate automatically on the Jetson via `#ifdef __linux__` guards.

**The graph will grow on the Jetson** through:
- Hebbian learning (automatic after each reasoning step)
- Feedback-driven tuning (from motor/cognitive feedback events)
- Novel concept detection (from vision/audio streams)
- Connection strengthening (co-occurring sensory features)

**Updates from Mac** can be deployed via simple Git workflow:
```bash
# On Mac: make changes, commit, push
git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push

# On Jetson: pull, rebuild, restart
ssh melvin@192.168.55.1 "cd /home/melvin/MELVIN && git pull && make && sudo systemctl restart melvin"
```

🎉 **Melvin is ready to wake up on the Jetson and start learning!**
