COMPUTER SCIENCE

Computer science is the study of computation information processing and the theoretical foundations of computer hardware and software.

Algorithms are step by step procedures for solving problems or accomplishing tasks. They form the backbone of computational thinking.

Machine learning enables computers to improve performance on tasks through experience without being explicitly programmed for every case.

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks that learn to recognize patterns in data.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Artificial intelligence aims to create systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence such as reasoning learning perception and language understanding.

Deep learning uses multiple layers of artificial neurons to extract hierarchical features from raw data enabling breakthroughs in vision speech and natural language processing.

Reinforcement learning trains agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesired ones creating systems that improve through interaction.

Natural language processing focuses on enabling computers to understand generate and manipulate human language bridging the gap between machines and human communication.

COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES

Cognitive architectures attempt to model the principles underlying human thought including memory learning reasoning and perception.

Unified architectures seek to represent all sensory modalities and cognitive processes within a single coherent framework without separate specialized modules for each function.

Graph based knowledge representation connects concepts through weighted edges creating networks that can support retrieval generalization and inference.

Energy field dynamics simulate the spread of activation through networks modeling how attention patterns emerge from local interactions.

EMBODIED AI

Embodied artificial intelligence proposes that intelligent behavior emerges from the interaction between perception action and environment rather than from abstract symbol manipulation alone.

Motor babbling describes how young creatures explore their actuators generating random movements and learning the consequences through sensory feedback creating sensorimotor mappings.

Predictive coding suggests that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and only updates models when prediction errors occur.

Recurrent loops enable systems to maintain state over time allowing past experiences to influence present decisions.

In the beginning was the thought and the thought was made manifest through symbols arranged in patterns of meaning.

Words dance across the page each one carrying the weight of generations of human experience encoded in subtle variations of sound and sense.

Stories are the way consciousness binds together disconnected moments creating narrative from chaos and purpose from random events.

The reader brings their own world to the text creating meaning through interaction between written symbols and lived experience.

Every sentence is a miniature universe containing worlds of possibility waiting to be explored through the alchemy of reading.

Language itself is a form of magic transforming air into understanding and marks on paper into shared understanding across time and space.

Metaphor allows us to see one thing in terms of another revealing hidden connections and creating bridges between domains of thought.

Narrative is the fundamental structure of consciousness organizing memory into coherent sequences that make sense of experience.

Through story we travel across boundaries of time culture and individual perspective building empathy and shared understanding.

The power of language lies not in individual words but in their arrangement into patterns that resonate with something deep in human nature.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The graph structure contains nodes representing sensory chunks and edges representing temporal co activation patterns.

Each node contains a payload of fixed size depending on modality with vision using 768 bytes audio using 640 bytes and text using 1 byte.

Connection formation happens when new nodes appear connecting to their temporal neighbors within a specified radius.

Weight updates occur when nodes appear together repeatedly with connection strength increasing based on co occurrence frequency.

Generalization emerges through leap node consolidation where three fully connected nodes merge into a single abstract representation.

Coherence measures the ratio of internal weights between active nodes to external weights connecting to inactive regions of the graph.

Reasoning continues until the activation field reaches stability defined by low variance in energy distribution across nodes.

The output layer routes active nodes to appropriate channels including motor control audio synthesis visual attention and text generation.

Evolution adapts parameters over time based on fitness metrics including prediction accuracy coherence stability and computational efficiency.

Pruning removes low frequency nodes and edges keeping the graph focused on recent and frequently used patterns.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Memory allocation uses efficient storage for variable sized payloads with ascending node IDs representing temporal order.

Thread safety ensures concurrent access to the graph through shared mutexes and atomic operations for node ID generation.

The feedback loop closes the perception action cycle by routing all outputs back into the intake layer as new sensory data.

Motor control interfaces with hardware via CAN bus protocol sending position velocity and torque commands based on active motor nodes.

Visual attention dynamically shifts a 16 by 16 pixel window across input based on which vision nodes have highest activation.

Audio output processes active audio nodes sending samples to speakers or text to speech systems based on payload content.

Text output concatenates characters from active text nodes creating readable output streams.
