## 1) Current State Summary

This section summarizes evidenced capabilities from the codebase and the rigorous test harness.

- Cognitive core
  - Unified Reasoning Engine with 13 human-like mechanisms integrated into `generate_output()` (goal relevance, causal edges, working memory, context, uncertainty, internal dialogue, coherence checking, meta-reasoning, schemas, reflective learning, temporal relations, narrative, evaluation).
  - World model and probabilistic extensions defined; partial implementation.
  - Meta/affective modulation and genome-based adaptation hooks present.
- Rigorous testing (Phase 2)
  - Harness supports seeded runs, ablations, and per-test execution.
  - Implemented tests (passing): Field stability (converges < 50 ticks), Internal Dialogue (trap error reduction).
  - Implemented (borderline): Uncertainty calibration (ECE ~= 0.05).
- Orchestration
  - Demo/test binaries run deterministically; default suite executes full + ablations.
  - CSV logging stubbed; docs and CLI flags in place; nightly shell runner present.
- Persistence
  - Graph storage header exists; binary graph/node/token formats referenced across repo; snapshots/WAL not yet centralized.
- I/O
  - Multiple demos for audio/voice/TTS and conversation exist; unified streaming orchestrator not yet present.
- Safety/observability
  - Metrics structs and printing hooks exist; no production metrics exporter or health endpoints yet.

Conclusion: The cognitive substrate is strong and modular; the production orchestration, durable state, continuous multi-modal streaming, and safety are partial/missing.

## 2) Architecture Analysis (readiness for always-on operation)

- Cognitive loop and reasoning pipeline
  - The loop is callable per tick within demos/tests, with integrated mechanisms and meta-control. Boundaries for compute/latency budgets are not enforced yet.
- Orchestration layer
  - No dedicated, long-running orchestrator process with pacing, health, and recovery. Sleep/replay and consolidation are present conceptually but not scheduled by an always-on daemon.
- Durability and state
  - Graph, embeddings, and genome live across files; no unified StateManager that handles snapshots, WAL, and recovery.
- Observability
  - Metrics and debugging printouts exist; Prometheus/OpenMetrics exporter, logs pipeline, and SLO dashboards are absent.
- Feature flags
  - Mechanism toggles exist in test harness CLI; production feature flag system (hot reload, config, rollout) is not yet wired.

---

## 3) Embodiment Readiness (motors, audio, camera)

- Motor control (CAN / RMD-X)
  - Repo includes motor subsystem files; a continuous closed-loop torque/position controller integrated with the cognitive loop is not present.
  - Safety/watchdogs: not present (limits, e-stop, current/thermal derate, soft bounds).
- Audio/vision streaming
  - Audio and speech demos exist; camera integration for 20–30 Hz frame ingestion into AtomicGraph not wired as a continuous stream with timestamps.
  - Cross-modal binding and synchronization (timestamps, alignment) not implemented as a dedicated service.
- Online adaptation
  - Genome/meta-learning scaffolding exists; production-safe gating (AQS thresholds, bounded updates, rollbacks) not implemented.

Missing components for embodiment
- Continuous perception loops: camera/mic streams → embedding → node activation with time alignment.
- Motor driver service: low-latency CAN I/O with feedback, safety controller, and goal tracking.
- Speech I/O service: mic capture + VAD → tokens; TTS output pipeline; audio↔text grounding.
- Hardware safety: watchdogs, compliance layer, and e-stop.

## 4) Text → Perception/Motor Generalization

- Symbolic (text) → motor
  - Current: schemas and goals exist; no explicit mapping from abstract verbs → motor goal states/trajectories.
  - Needed: motor goal encoder (text/action schema → latent motor goal) + controller (goal → joint/torque commands) + grounded success signals.
- Symbolic (text) → vision expectations
  - Current: context vector + embeddings; no predictive visual embeddings conditioned on language queries.
  - Needed: shared cross-modal embedding and a predictor that primes attention to expected visual patterns.
- Symbolic (text) → audio
  - Current: TTS demos exist; no integrated auditory expectation loop linking semantics ↔ phonemes ↔ microphone input for self-monitoring.
- Concept grounding
  - Current: concept nodes/schemas are primarily symbolic; partial affect/metrics; missing grounded links to pixels/torques/waveforms.
  - Needed: unified latent manifold aligning text, vision, audio, motor (contrastive pretraining or online grounding via self-supervised objectives).

## 8) Minimal API/Process Sketch

- Endpoints
  - /think (async), /ask (stream), /ingest (batch/stream), /adapt (flags), /snapshot, /metrics, /health.
- Processes
  - Orchestrator (daemon) → schedules ticks + sleep/replay; owns pacing.

---

## 9) Acceptance Criteria for Production Beta

- Always-on orchestration with bounded compute and auto-recovery.
- Continuous camera/mic streams → stable perception at 20–30 Hz.
- Motor control with closed-loop feedback and safety; dry-run simulators for CI.
- Uncertainty ECE ≤ 0.05 across nightly tests; debate improves trap tasks ≥ 20%.
- Schema transfer and Pareto improvements logged; ablations green.
- Snapshots/WAL proven with forced crash tests; recovery ≤ 60s.
- Dashboards: AQS, coherence, entropy, latency, contradiction rate, mode/util.

## 10) Final Readiness Verdict

- Current label: Research/Alpha
- Strengths: rich cognitive mechanisms, meta-control, initial rigorous tests.
- Primary gaps: continuous orchestration, durable state, real-time I/O, safety, grounding.
- Path forward: 4 milestones above elevate to a “self-learning embodied system” capable of thinking, taking in data, answering, learning, growing, and adapting continuously on real hardware.
